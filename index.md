Heya! I'm an errorist, weeaboo, technologist & ThoughtWorker.

During my daily adventures in softwareland I end up with some thoughts or discussions that seem worth sharing, I'll try to record them here and broadcast on [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/Caligin35).

Hope that you'll find it useful!

Also: I might post non-tech things from time to time.
